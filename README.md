I just executed a new Chrome extension idea by using deepseek (vibe coding) — Stand Up Reminder

It helps you stay active and healthy while working by reminding you to stand, stretch, and move at regular intervals.
✅ Set your own reminder time
✅ See a live countdown
✅ Simple, private, and works offline

Small breaks = big benefits for your health and focus.
