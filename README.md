I just executed a new Chrome extension idea by using deepseek (vibe coding) — **Stand Up Reminder**

<p>It helps you stay active and healthy while working by reminding you to stand, stretch, and move at regular intervals. </p>
✅ Set your own reminder time <br>
✅ See a live countdown <br>
✅ Simple, private, and works offline <br>

<br>
<p>Small breaks = big benefits for your health and focus.</p>
